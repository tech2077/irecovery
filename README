== What is iRecovery? ==

iRecovery is a libusb-based commandline utility for Mac OS X and Linux (perhaps windows too but I'm not developing/testing under windows). It is able to talk to the iBoot/iBSS in Apple's iPhone/iPod touch via USB.

It's completely open-source, the source-code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.
The full license text can be found in the LICENSE file.

It currently connects to 0x1281 (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod touch, iPod touch 2G, iPod touch 3G, iPod touch 4G (no commands other than setenv, saveenv, and reboot are known): Recovery Mode/iBSS), 0x1227 (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod touch: WTF Mode; iPod touch 2G: DFU Mode).
